		<h2>Task Overview</h2>
		<p>Over the next two weeks you will be working in teams of 2 or 3 to produce a landing page for a future version of this coding course. The aim of the landing page will be to advertise the course and to collect the email addresses of interested participants.</p>

<h3 id='learning_outcomes'>Learning outcomes</h3>

<p>The purpose of the task is to bring together what you have already learned about HTML and CSS, and to start you thinking about how you can apply the skills you already have to marketing a start-up.</p>

<p>Over the coming weeks you will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Practise making a page look good with HTML and CSS.</li>

<li>Practise collaborative coding.</li>

<li>Practise putting up a simple webform that submits to a Google doc.</li>

<li>Learn about basic web analytics.</li>
</ul>

		<h2>The brief</h2>
		<p>The first part of this task is to produce the basic landing page layout and copy.</p>

<ul>
<li>The design of the page and the text is up to you but must reflect the content and format described below.</li>

<li>The page should have a single &#8220;call to action&#8221;. If they click on the &#8220;call to action&#8221; users should be taken to a blank page called <code>form.html</code>. Next session we will learn how to create a form on this page.</li>

<li>You may call the course whatever you think best describes it!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='the_content'>The content</h3>

<p>The course being offered is an introduction to HTML, CSS and git. It is basically the same material that you have covered up til now in Web Fundamentals 1-4.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s up to you to present this content in the way you think would be most compelling to someone in your position when you signed up. For example you could focus on the technologies they will learn, or you might want to focus on the things they&#8217;ll be able to do. Totally up to you!</p>

<h3 id='the_format'>The format</h3>

<p>The course will be offered in 7 one-hour, weekly sessions. The following things are important:</p>

<ul>
<li>attendees must commit to making every single session</li>

<li>they must commit to putting in 4 hours work outside the course each week</li>
</ul>

<p>As the course is being offered for free it&#8217;s important to get this in somewhere, though it could be on the sign-up form.</p>
