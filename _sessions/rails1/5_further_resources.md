title: Rails resources
---

We are not going to do much more Rails in class, but I strongly recommend you use it for your project. I'm hoping that the stuff we've done with Sinatra will have given you enough of insight to be able to effectively discover rails for yourselves. 

One resource that you'll definitely want to have a look at is [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com). For most things you'll want to do in rails there's a railscast telling you how to do it! They're really clear and demonstrate exactly where to put stuff in your rails application. Even if you're not trying to do anything in particular, watching a couple of railscasts is a great way to passively discover more about how rails works. Here are a few you might want to start with:

* http://railscasts.com/episodes/417-foundation: an overview of a Twitter Bootstrap - like framework called Foundation.
* http://railscasts.com/episodes/310-getting-started-with-rails: advice on how to get started with rails.
* http://railscasts.com/episodes/360-facebook-authentication: how to integrate facebook log-in into your app.
* http://railscasts.com/episodes/209-introducing-devise: how to easily provide a log-in to your site, using [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) (this is how you should do authentication!) [Warning: old but probably still relevant].
* http://railscasts.com/episodes/328-twitter-bootstrap-basics: a ruby gem to make adding Twitter Bootstrap to your app easier.


[RailsApps](http://railsapps.github.io/twitter-bootstrap-rails.html) is a great site with many nice tutorials. There's also the [learn rails book](http://learn-rails.com/) which **you can currently get for free**, provided you're willing to give feedback. If you're using this book I'd recommend starting with Chapters 9 and then 14 (and then flicking back and forth as necessary). It's well worth working through - it guides you through a mail list signup and management application, including integration with MailChimp.

There's also the [Rails Tutorial book](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book) by Michael Hartl, which gives a thorough and up-to-date tutorial for building a rails app.

Finally, as will all web things, Google is probably your most useful resource for answering most questions!
