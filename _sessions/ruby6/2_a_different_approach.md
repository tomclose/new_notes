title: A different approach

The hash is a bit clunky. We have to pass the hash in to each function.

It would be nicer if we could tie the functions and data together. We can do this by using classes.

How would this work?

{% highlight ruby %}
books = [ ... ]
l = Library.new(books)


#TODO

{% endhighlight %}

### Syntax for classes

{% highlight ruby %}
#TODO
{% endhighlight %}

{% exercise %}
1. Open `ruby6/library_class.rb` in Sublime Text.
2. Complete the definition of the class.
3. Check your answers by running `test_library_class.rb`.
