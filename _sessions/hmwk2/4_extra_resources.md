### HTML/CSS

This is not quite the end of what we'll be doing with HTML and CSS, but we probably won't spend a lot more time on it. From now on we will be using it as a tool, rather than studying it in its own right. If you want to know more about HTML and CSS here are a few good resources:

* [HTML/CSS notes by Shay Howe](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/): this is an excellent and thorough set of HTML and CSS notes, by a guy who clearly knows his stuff. Well worth a look.
* [HTMLdog tutorials](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/): a good set of tutorials ranging from beginner to advanced.
* [Codecademy Web Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web): if you haven't done it already!
* [Taming advanced CSS selectors](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/17/taming-advanced-css-selectors/): a detailed description of how browsers decide which CSS rules to apply.

### Ruby

We'll be doing loads more Ruby over the course - it'll be core to a lot of things we do, so it's important to keep on top of it. If you need extra practice, or an alternative way of looking at things check out some of the resources below:

* [Codecademy Ruby Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby): we've currently covered the material from "Section 1: Introduction to Ruby"
* [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org): you had a look at this last homework. You're welcome to carry on through it.
* [Progamming Ruby 1.9](http://it-ebooks.info/book/59/): *the* Ruby 1.9 manual. Available for **free download** - get it quick. Probably a bit complicated as you're starting out, but will be invaluable later in the course.
