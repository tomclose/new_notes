title: HTML/CSS resources
---

This is not quite the end of what we'll be doing with HTML and CSS, but we probably won't spend a lot more time on it. From now on we will be using it as a tool, rather than studying it in its own right. If you want to know more about HTML and CSS here are a few good resources:

* [HTML/CSS notes by Shay Howe](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/): this is an excellent and thorough set of HTML and CSS notes, by a guy who clearly knows his stuff. Well worth a look.
* [HTMLdog tutorials](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/): a good set of tutorials ranging from beginner to advanced.
* [Codecademy Web Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web): if you haven't done it already!
* [More about CSS selectors](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize/): Pretty much everything you could ever want to know about CSS selectors (and more)
* [Taming advanced CSS selectors](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/17/taming-advanced-css-selectors/): a detailed description of how browsers decide which CSS rules to apply.
