title: "Coallaboration: Sharing model"
---

The other way or collaborating with git is the 'sharing' model: one person puts the repository on github and gives other people permissions, so you can all push to the same place.

To do this on github, go to your forked landing page repository and click on 'Settings' on the right hand side. Then go to 'Collaborators' and add your team members' github usernames.
