### Forking

One of the options for sharing your changes with me, is for you to publish your repository too. I can then pull your changes down just as you pulled mine.

Notice that this situation is symmetric - my repositories are equivalent to yours. This makes it a suitable model for many open source projects, where the project maintainer might change over time.

Github makes this model easy by 
providing a 'forking' button. Go to [github.com/TomClose/landing_page](github.com/TomClose/landing_page) and press the 'Fork' button. You now have a copy of my repository that you can push to if you want to. If you want to send me some changes you can do this by going back to [github.com/TomClose/landing_page](github.com/TomClose/landing_page) and submitting a 'pull request'.

### Sharing

The other way or collaborating with git is the 'sharing' model: one person puts the repository on github and gives other people permissions, so you can all push to the same place.

To do this on github, go to your forked landing page repository and click on 'Settings' on the right hand side. Then go to 'Collaborators' and add your team members' github usernames.
