title: "Collaboration: Forking model"
---

You're now able to get someone else's code. What about sharing your changes with them. Try doing:

    git push

You'll find that you can't push to my repository.

One of the options for sharing your changes with me, is for you to publish your repository too. I can then pull your changes down just as you pulled mine.

Notice that this situation is symmetric - my repositories are equivalent to yours. This makes it a suitable model for many open source projects, where the project maintainer might change over time.

Github makes this model easy by providing a 'forking' button. Go to [github.com/TomClose/landing_page](github.com/TomClose/landing_page) and press the 'Fork' button. You now have a copy of my repository that you can push to if you want to. If you want do send me some changes you can do this by going back to [github.com/TomClose/landing_page](github.com/TomClose/landing_page) and submitting a 'pull request'.
