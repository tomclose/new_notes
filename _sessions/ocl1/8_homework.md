### Buy a domain name

Your domain name will be used to point towards your personal website for the course - it's up to you exactly what this will be about. You might want to use this opportunity to create a basic 'personal landing page' saying a bit about yourself and where to find more information. Or you might want to put up a blog. Alternatively if you want you can put up a page about something you are interested in (or [your dog](http://jamfly.info/)). You will need to pick a domain name accordingly!

To buy a domain name you need to visit a domain registrar. Examples are:

* [123-reg](http://www.123-reg.co.uk/)
* [Godaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/)
* [Namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com/)

There probably won't be a huge difference in price between these sites. You might be able to find a special offer on one of them if you shop around a bit though. Ultimately the domain you choose isn't that important for the course - the whole point is to practice pointing a domain name towards a server.

Buy your own domain name.

### Preparation for next time

{% exercise %}
1. Complete the whole of Project 2 on the [General Assembly Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/projects) site. 
2. [Try git](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) (up to stage 1.9).
3. (Optional) Do the projects from the [Codecademy Web Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) Sections 4, 5 &amp; 6.

### Make a start on your own site

{% exercise %}
Use what you've learnt from the HTML exercise and the Dash projects to improve your `first_site/index.html`. Maybe add some content about yourself. Don't worry if it doesn't look great yet - we'll be working on it more in the next few weeks. Just make sure it says something more than 'Hello'!
