Welcome to the course preparation for the Learn to Code programme!

### Programme content

The aim of this programme is to give you a taste of a number of different areas of web development. We don't aim to make you an expert in any one of them; instead we want to give you a basic level of understanding and the tools to test things out, so that you can independently learn more.

Over the two parts of the course you will meet:

* HTML
* CSS
* git
* Ruby
* javascript
* Ruby on Rails

There are many excellent resources on the web for learning a lot of this material. We don't want to reinvent the wheel and will unashamedly point you towards better sources of information when they exist. Rather than teach you everything from scratch, we aim to guide and support your learning. 

### Course assessment

There will be no formal assessment for the course - you can't pass or fail. The only measure of success is the knowledge and skills that you take away.

We will be setting you a fair amount of independent work in between sessions and it's up to you to do this - we won't always be checking. In many ways, the biggest value in this course comes from the access to support from our excellent TA team. Do not underestimate how important this is or what a unique opportunity you have! **If you don't keep up with the work, you will get little value from the course.**

### Installing software

One of the biggest challenges in a course like this is dealing with the different operating systems and hardware that you'll be working on. We have decided against getting everyone to run a linux virtual machine (or similar) for the course, as we believe it's really important that web development is something that you can do in your natural computing environment.

That does mean that there's a fair amount of setting up that you will need to do to be ready for the first session next week. Please be patient with this - installing software is fiddly and not always predictable. Most of the work we get you to do won't be like this!

The tabs on the left hand side will take you through installing the software you'll need for the course. Instructions are given in blue boxes.
