### Why do I need Chrome?

Chrome is a free web browser provided by Google. There are several other web browsers that you might have used, including Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox and Opera. We will be using Chrome as it comes with a good set of developer tools that we will be using over the course.

[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) also comes with an excellent set of developer tools (via its [firebug extension](http://getfirebug.com/)). There doesn't seem to be much between Chrome and Firefox+firebug as far as the tools we'll be using go. The decision to recommend Chrome was fairly arbitrary, but means that everyone will be using the same software.
