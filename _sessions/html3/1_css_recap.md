title: CSS Recap
---

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to tell the web browser how to display the HTML it receives. Using CSS you can specify everything:
- fonts
- colours
- background images
- layout/positioning
- ... and much more

Last session we looked at adding CSS directly to the `<head>` section of the webpage. Later in this session we will see how to put the css in a different file, which is more efficient and easier to maintain. 

To remind yourself of what we did last week:
1. Go to the folder `coding_course/learning_css`
2. Open `notes.html` in Sublime Text and also in Chrome
3. See if you can change all the paragraph text to green
