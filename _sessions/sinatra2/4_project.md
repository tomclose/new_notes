title: Project
---

This project is completely optional. It is meant for those who feel they already have a good understanding of sinatra and want to stretch themselves.

Take a look at this [simple word cloud maker](http://calm-savannah-9937.herokuapp.com/).

Your challenge is to build something similar (hopefully better!).

{% exercise %}
1. Fork the project on github: [https://github.com/code61/sinatra_project2](https://github.com/code61/sinatra_project2)
2. Clone your fork onto your laptop.
3. Read the notes in `app.rb`.
4. Using `ruby4/i_have_a_dream.rb` as a reference, create a sinatra app that creates a word cloud.
5. Improve your site. You might like to consider:
    * adding twitter bootstrap;
    * reading through the [d3](http://d3js.org/) code in `word_cloud.erb` and changing bits to see what they do;
    * take a look at [other d3 wordcloud examples](http://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/#) (currently seems a bit broken - try going to the 'custom' tag and pasting in some text).
