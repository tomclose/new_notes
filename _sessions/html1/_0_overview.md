### Who is this course for?

- You want to start a start-up and be your own technical cofounder
- You want to have your own blog and understand how it works
- You want to have the foundations to teach yourself more

### What will we learn

- How to inspect and learn from other sites
- How to put up a webpage
- Basic skills and tools that will be useful for any coding you do

Hope you will become curious about how the internet works and will look at websites in a different way.

It's worth pointing out that this is *not* the easiest way to put up a website. There are many site builders/blogging platforms which will allow you to put up a website quickly and easily in a point-and-click manner (eg. [weebly](http://www.weebly.com/) or [wordpress](http://wordpress.com/)). The focus of this course is learning the basics of how and why things work and to provide the basis to build upon in future courses.

### How to study

The hardest thing about learning to program is knowing where to start and what to learn. The course aims to provide a basic overview of the technologies used, along with the tools and resources to discover more. We do not aim to cover anything in great depth or comprehensive detail.

The lectures will be as hands-on and practical as possible. Each week there will be a number of tasks to do in between the sessions to reinforce what you have learnt. It's up to you whether you do the tasks or not, but the more you put in the more you will get out!
