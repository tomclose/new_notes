title: Creating an HTML page
---

We'll now create our first HTML page.

<div class='exercise' markdown="1">
	1. Create a new folder in your documents called 'coding_course'
	2. Inside that create another folder called 'first_site'
	3. Open Sublime Text
	4. Write "Hello"
	5. Save the file as 'index.html' in the 'first_site' folder
	6. Open 'index.html' in Chrome (File > Open ...)
</div>

Sublime Text is a text editor. When writing HTML (and code in general) it's important to use a program that doesn't add any formatting of its own. For example, if you wrote "hello" and saved it in Microsoft Word it would create a complicated file which would include a load of formatting information and other stuff. We want files to be saved exactly how we see them.

There are many different possibilities for text editors. You probably already have one of Notepad or TextEdit on your computer. Sublime Text (and other editors such as NotePad++, Vim, gEdit, ..) will add _syntax highlighting_ for you - they'll colour different bits of your progamming language to make it easier to read.

{% exercise %}
1. Go back to 'index.html' in Sublime Text.
2. Change the text to

		&lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;

3. Go back to 'index.html' in Chrome and press the refresh button.

This is your first real html tag. It has an open and a close. It tells it to be a heading.
