1. Make sure you are in your `coding_course` folder
2. Clone the repo for this session. In the command line type:

        $ git clone https://github.com/code61/learning_html.git

3. Check that you now have the `learning_html` folder and move into it:

        $ ls
        $ cd learning_html

4. Open the whole folder in Sublime Text
5. Open the file `example.html` in Chrome and look around with the developer tools
6. Open the file `notes.html` in Sublime Text.
7. Change `notes.html` into valid html so that it looks like `notes_solution.jpg`

A few things to look out for

### HTML file layout

{% highlight html %}
<DOCTYPE! html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        ...
    </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

* The doctype tells you what sort of html you're using (html5, html4 ...). With html5 it's simple - you just write `html`.
* Everything is wrapped in an `<html> ... </html>` tag
* Only things within the `<body> ... </body>` tags are displayed on the page 
* Things within the `<head> .. </head>` are used to provide more information about the page
* .. for exmple the thing within `<title> ... </title>` will be displayed in the browser bar

### Headings

{% highlight html %}
<h1>Top level heading</h1>

<h3>Lower level heading</h3>
{% endhighlight %}

* There are six levels of heading `h1` .. `h6`
* The higher numbers are more important
* It's usual to only have one `h1` on a page
* You rarely see anything below `h4` in real pages

### Paragraphs and text

{% highlight html %}
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<p>This is another paragraph. It has some <em>italic text</em> and some <strong>bold text</strong>.</p>
{% endhighlight %}

* Paragraphs are created using the `<p>` tag
* The `<em>` tag is used to provide emphasis. In reality that means italics - in fact the tag `<i>` also works. Using em is better though as it fits with the idea of *semantic markup* - marking your information as to its meaning, instead of how you want it to look.
* The `<strong>` tag is used to make text stand out. It basically means bold - `<b>` also works, but `<strong>` is better - see above.

### Comments

{% highlight html %}
<!-- comments look like this -->
{% endhighlight %}

* Comments will not display in the page ...
* ... but they will display in the page source. Don't be rude!

### Lists

{% highlight html %}
<ul>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Oranges</li>
</ul>
{% endhighlight %}

* Lists have a nested structure
* `<ul>` is for an *unordered* list. This means bullet points.
* `<ol>` is for an *ordered* list. That means automatic numbering.
* In both types of list you add items using a `<li>` tag. This stands for *list item*.

### Links

{% highlight html %}
<a href="http://www.facebook.com">this is a link to facebook</a>
{% endhighlight %}

* The `href` property tells you where the link will point
* You can specify this link it different ways:
    * absolute external link e.g. "http://www.facebook.com"
    * absolute local link e.g. "/about". This links to a file relative to the root of your webserver. For example if your site is at `www.example.com` the link will point to `www.example.com/about`
    * relative local link e.g. "about". This links to a file relative to the current html document. In this case it will link to the file called `about` in the same folder as your current html file.
* You can also link to places in the same document using `href="#my_tag"`. This 
* You can get the link to open in a new tag like this: `<a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">

### Images

{% highlight html %}
<img alt='my cat' src="my_cat.png">
{% endhighlight %}

* The `alt` tag is for providing a description of your image. This is useful for partially sighted people using screen readers, or in case the image doesn't load. 
* The file can be linked to in the same way as href. In the example above we use a relative local link to a file called `my_cat.png` in the same folder as the html file.

### Tables

{% highlight html %}
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Column1 Heading</th>
            <th>Column2 Heading</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Row1, Column1</td>
            <td>Row1, Column2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row2, Column1</td>
            <td>Row2, Column2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row3, Column1</td>
            <td>Row3, Column2</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

{% endhighlight %}
