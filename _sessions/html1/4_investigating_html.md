title: Investigating HTML
---

HTML (*HyperText Markup Language*) is a way of writing information so that it can be interpreted by a web browser. It is *not* a programming language - you can't do calculations in it - it is a _markup_ language.

Back in the early days of the web HTML would both store the information and tell the browser how to display it. People then realised that this was a bad idea - making a small change such as changing the colour of a heading would require edits all over the place, which made sites hard to maintain. HTML is now used just to display the information (text etc.) that is stored in the page.

{% exercise %}
1. Open this page in Google Chrome
2. View the page source (View > Developer > View Source)
{% endexercise %}

HTML probably won't make a lot of sense to you at first but you might be able to see some of the words from the page.

A slightly nicer way to look at HTML is to use the Chrome Developer Tools.

{% exercise %}
1. Open this page in Google Chrome
2. Look at the page using developer tools by doing one of the following:
    * View > Developer > Developer Tools
    * Tools > Developer Tools
{% endexercise %}

Using the magnifying glass (bottom left) You can hover over the bits of the page and it will show you the relevant bits of HTML. We will use Chrome Developer Tools a lot throughout the course.
