title: The brief
---

The first part of this task is to produce the basic landing page layout and copy.

* The design of the page and the text is up to you but must reflect the content and format described below.
* The page should have a single "call to action". If they click on the "call to action" users should be taken to a blank page called `form.html`. Next session we will learn how to create a form on this page.
* You can assume the course is being offered by an organisation called "CodingCoursesInc". This will change at a later date and should be present, but not prominent, on the page.
* You may call the course whatever you think best describes it!

### The content

The course being offered is an introduction to HTML, CSS and git. It is basically the same material that you have covered up til now in Web Fundamentals 1-4.

It's up to you to present this content in the way you think would be most compelling to someone in your position 4 weeks ago. For example you could focus on the technologies they will learn, or you might want to focus on the things they'll be able to do. Totally up to you!

### The format

The course will be offered in 7 one-hour, weekly sessions. The following things are important:

* attendees must commit to making every single session
* they must commit to putting in 3 hours work outside the course each week

As the course is being offered for free it's important to get this in somewhere, though it could be on the sign-up form.
