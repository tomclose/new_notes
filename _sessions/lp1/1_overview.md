title: Task Overview
---

Over the next two weeks you will be working in teams of 3 or 4 to produce a landing page for an extra-curricular coding course to be offered at a local university. The aim of the landing page will be to advertise the course and to collect the email addresses of interested participants.

### Learning outcomes

The purpose of the task is to bring together what you have already learned about HTML and CSS, and to start you thinking about how you can apply the skills you already have to marketing a start-up.

Over the coming weeks you will:

* Practise making a page look good with HTML and CSS.
* Practise collaborative coding.
* Learn how to put up a simple webform that submits to a Google doc.
* Learn about basic web analytics.
* Learn how to perform a basic A/B test to optimize your landing page.

### Is this for real?

Yes. EntrepreneurFirst is investigating the possibility of putting on courses similar to CodeFirst: Girls at a number of universities across the country. Putting up a course landing page and collecting the email addresses of those interested will be a first step in validating the assumption that there is demand for such courses.

We will use the best landing pages to advertise the course at chosen universities!
