[Google Analytics](http://www.google.co.uk/analytics/) is a free analytics service from Google. It will allow you to collect information on who is visiting your site and what they are doing there.

Google Analytics works using javascript: when a user loads your page, some javascript on the page sends a message to Google Analytics containing information about the user. You can then log in via the Google Analytics admin panel to view this information.

### Installing Google Analytics

1. Sign up/log in at [http://www.google.co.uk/analytics/]()
2. Create a new account for your site (Admin > + New Account)
3. Follow the instructions they give to paste the analytics javascript into your page.
