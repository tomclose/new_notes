title: Setting up goals
---

Google Analytics will allow you to set up goals for users on your site. You can define these goals in terms of urls that you want users to reach. For your landing page the goal will be for a user to reach the `thanks.html` page (which will mean they have signed up).

{% exercise %}
1. In the Admin section, set up a goal that a user reaches the `thanks.html` page. Add the `index.html` and `form.html` as steps.
2. Push your code to github. See if you can see your goal being met on the realtime tab.
