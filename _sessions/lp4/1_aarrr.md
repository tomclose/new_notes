title: AARRR metrics

The [lean startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) views a startup as a
<blockquote>
    <p> temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.</p>
</blockquote>

Searching for a repeatable and scalable business model is an iterative procedure, involving many cycles of the feedback loop:

In this session we will be looking at the 'measure/data' components of the loop.

### Actionable metrics vs vanity metrics

It is important to think carefully about the metrics that you will collect and measure. It's really easy to fall into the trap of collecting vanity metrics e.g.

* We have 10k visitors per day.
* We have 2500 users.

These might be interesting to know, but they're not *actionable* - they don't help you know what to work on next. Actionable metrics are things like:

* Of the people who come to our landing page 40% click on the 'signup' button.
* Of our signed up users, 30% log in everyday, but 40% haven't logged in more than once.

Actionable metrics tell you what you need to work on next.

### Startup metrics for pirates: AARRR ...

When you're thinking about startup metrics it is useful to group them into 5 main areas:

* **Acquisition**: getting people to come to your site.
* **Activation**: getting people to take the first steps e.g. sign up/create an event/etc.
* **Retention**: getting people to come back.
* **Referral**: getting people to tell their friends.
* **Revenue**: getting people to give you money!

These ideas were popularised by Dave McClure in his well known [startup metrics for pirates](http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2007/09/startup-metrics.html) talk.
