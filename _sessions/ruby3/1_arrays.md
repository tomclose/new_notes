title: Arrays
---

An array is a way of storing a list of objects. Unlike in some other languages in ruby you don't need to specify which sort of object the array will hold - it can even hold objects of different types.

Arrays are written with square brackets.
{% highlight ruby %}
my_array = [1,2,3]

empty_array = []    # an array with no elements
{% endhighlight %}

1. Grab the code for this session:

        git clone https://github.com/code61/ruby3.git

2. With your partner work through the file `array_examples.rb`. See if you can guess what each line does, then check in irb.
