A favicon is the little picture that you see on the tab when you open a webpage. You can see some examples [here](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/01/31/inspire-yourself-50-remarkable-favicons/).

For your site to have a favicon you need to do two things:

1. Create a `favicon.ico` file and upload it as part of your site.
2. Link to that file in the head:

        <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico">

There are many sites that will help you to create a `favicon.ico` file from your logo. In my experience [this one](http://xiconeditor.com/) is the best.
