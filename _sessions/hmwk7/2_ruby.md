Continue to practice ruby. It really is up to you to get on top of the ruby we've done. We'll be moving on on Thursday.

{% exercise %}
1. Make sure you've done and understand the work from the sessions so far.
2. (Optional) practice at [try ruby](http://tryruby.org/). You should be able to get up to the end of level 7.
