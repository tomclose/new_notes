Take a look at [Fuck Off as a Service - FOAAS](http://foaas.herokuapp.com/) for example [foaas.herokuapp.com/off/boris/dave](http://foaas.herokuapp.com/off/boris/dave) or [foaas.herokuapp.com/shakespeare/boris/dave](http://foaas.herokuapp.com/shakespeare/boris/dave).

Your task is to implement something similar using Sinatra. For example:

* An alternative insult site.
* A complement site.
* .. use your imagination!

{% exercise %}
1. Go to [https://github.com/code61/sinatra_project_1](https://github.com/code61/sinatra_project_1) and press the fork button. This will give you your own copy of the project on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked version of the repo down onto your laptop (using the **ssh** clone URL on the bottom right of the repo page): in your `coding_course` folder run

        $ git clone paste_the_clone_URL_here

3. Use the outline project as a starting point for your work.
4. Once you've written a simple URL matcher, see if you can write a test for it in `tests.rb` (by copying examples from class).
5. At each stage `add`, `commit` and `push` your changes. (It should have automatically set itself up to push back up to your forked version on github.)

Please make this project as good as you can. We'll be deploying it online next time, so it'll be nice to have something to be proud of. You will probably want to consider adding bootstrap to your HTML templates and things.
