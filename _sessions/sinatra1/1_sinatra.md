title: Introducing sinatra

Sinatra is a lightweight web framework written in ruby.

### Getting sinatra

You can install sinatra on your laptop using [rubygems](http://rubygems.org/) - ruby's excellent package manager. When people write their own ruby libraries, they usually release them as a gem, so that others can quickly and easily install them. Sinatra is one of these libraries. To install it do:

    $ gem install sinatra

at the command line.
