It the next session we're going to be meeting three new things: ruby, git and css. It'll be quite a lot to take in. Give yourself a head start by trying out at least one of them beforehand.


{% exercise %}
(Optional) [Try ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0) (first level only - look in the URL).
{% endexercise %}

If you have a spare 5 mins it won't hurt to [try ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0). Don't worry if it doesn't make sense - more on this next time.

{% exercise %}
(Optional) [Try git](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) (up to stage 1.9).
{% endexercise %}

If you have another spare 5 mins it also won't hurt to [try git](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). Don't worry if it doesn't make sense - more on this next time too.

{% exercise %}
(Optional) Do the projects from the [Codecademy Web Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) Sections 4, 5 &amp; 6.
{% endexercise %}

We'll be looking at adding CSS next session. If you've done this beforehand you'll be in great shape for the class.
