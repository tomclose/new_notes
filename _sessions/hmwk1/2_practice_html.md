{% exercise %}
Finish the HTML exercise from class.
{% endexercise %}

Finish the example in `learning_html`. Make sure your `notes.html` now looks like `notes_solution.jpg`.

<hr>

{% exercise %}
Add to your `first_site/index.html` page.
{% endexercise %}

Make your `first_site/index.html` into a proper html document and add a bit more content. Up to you how far you go with this. We're going to be putting this online next session though, so it would be nice if it said more than "hello".
