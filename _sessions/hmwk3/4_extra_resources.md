### Ruby

We'll be doing loads more Ruby over the course - it'll be core to a lot of things we do, so it's important to keep on top of it. If you need extra practice, or an alternative way of looking at things check out some of the resources below:

* [Codecademy Ruby Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby): we've currently covered the material from "Section 1: Introduction to Ruby"
* [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org): you had a look at this last homework. You're welcome to carry on through it.
* [Progamming Ruby 1.9](http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/): *the* Ruby manual. Available  **free online**. Probably a bit complicated as you're starting out, but will be invaluable later in the course.
