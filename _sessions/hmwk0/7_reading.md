title: Preparation exercises

Well done for getting to this point! You should now have all the software you need to start the course.

In the first session we'll be looking at HTML: the markup language used for webpages. You might have seen some HTML before. If not, it would be useful if you were slightly familiar with it beforehand, as we won't spend that much time on it.

To make sure everyone's roughly in the same place we'd like you all to do some of the exercises at [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com). Codecademy is a free site that allows you to try out various programming languages directly in your browser. If you've already done some HTML, it might be slow going - because of this we **only want you to do the project** from each section. If you haven't done any HTML before, please feel free to do the exercises too.
