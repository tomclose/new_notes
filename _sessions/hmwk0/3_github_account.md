### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a site that allows you to share code with others. It basically allows you to put a *git repository* online. Git is a program that helps with the management of code. If you want, you can [find out a bit more about git](http://git-scm.com/) now - or you can wait until we cover it in the course.

There are several other sites that are similar to GitHub e.g. [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org). GitHub is by far the most widely used.

GitHub also allows you to put a static website online for free, using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) - another feature that we will be making use of during the course.
