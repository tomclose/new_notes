		<h2>Hello!</h2>
		<h3 id='what_is_ruby'>What is ruby?</h3>

<p>Ruby is a programming language. It is different to HTML and CSS, which are just <em>markup</em> languages: in ruby you can do calculations. We&#8217;ll start off with a demonstration:</p>
<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Navigate to your <code>coding_course</code> folder in the command line.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Clone the repo for this session:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/code61/ruby1.git</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Open the file <code>coding_course/ruby1/hello.rb</code> in Sublime Text</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the command line move into the <code>ruby1</code> folder and run the <code>hello.rb</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ruby1
$ ruby hello.rb</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>You should see the word &#8216;Hello&#8217; displayed in the terminal.</p>

<h3 id='what_just_happened'>What just happened?</h3>

<p>The first few steps were just to pull the code down from the online repository (using git). We&#8217;ll focus on steps 3 and 4. The file <code>hello.rb</code> contained some code in a language called ruby:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='c1'># print &#39;Hello&#39; to the screen</span>
<span class='nb'>puts</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;Hello&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id='comments'>Comments</h4>

<p>The first line is a comment - it doesn&#8217;t do anything. You should always comment your code, as it helps you (and others) understand what is going on when you come back to look at it later. Any text on a line that comes after a <code>#</code> is a comment:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='c1'># this whole line is a comment</span>

<span class='nb'>puts</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;hello&quot;</span>  <span class='c1'># this is a comment too</span>

<span class='cm'>=begin</span>
<span class='cm'>Any lines between a line beginning =begin and</span>
<span class='cm'>a line beginning =end are also treated as a comment.</span>
<span class='cm'>This style of commenting doesn&#39;t seem to be used that</span>
<span class='cm'>much in The Wild.</span>
<span class='cm'>=end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id='puts_and_strings'>Puts and strings</h4>

<p>The second line is where the magic is. <code>puts</code> stands for &#8220;put string&#8221;. A <em>string</em> is a programming term that is used to describe what you would probably call a piece of text. The second line displays the string &#8220;Hello&#8221; in the command line.</p>

<h4 id='running_the_program'>Running the program</h4>

<p>For the program to run we needed to call it using <code>ruby hello.rb</code>. <code>ruby</code> is a command line program that interprets and runs ruby files. When the ruby program gets to the end of the file it exits, giving you control of the command line again.</p>

<p>We say that ruby is an <em>interpreted</em> language - the ruby file is read in and executed in real time. Python, matlab and lisp are other interpreted languages that you might have heard of. You might also have come across <em>compiled</em> languages such as c, c++ and (to some extent) java. These languages require a pre-processing stage (called <em>compiling</em>) in order to turn the code into a program that the computer can run.</p>
<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<p>Modify <code>hello.rb</code>, so that the program will display &#8220;Hello, your-name&#8221;. Run the program from the command line to check that it works.</p>
</div>
	</div>

	
	<div class="tab-pane " id="2_reading_ruby">
	

		<h2>Reading ruby</h2>
		<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the file <code>ruby1/times.rb</code> in Sublime Text.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>What do you think this program does?</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Run the program to see if you&#8217;re right:</p>

<pre><code>$ ruby times.rb</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><code>times.rb</code> contains the single line:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'> 
<span class='p'>(</span><span class='mi'>1</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>.</span><span class='mi'>12</span><span class='p'>)</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>each</span> <span class='p'>{</span> <span class='o'>|</span><span class='n'>number</span><span class='o'>|</span> <span class='nb'>puts</span> <span class='mi'>3</span> <span class='o'>*</span> <span class='n'>number</span> <span class='p'>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We&#8217;re not going to worry about precisely how the instruction works at the moment - we&#8217;ll learn about this in detail over the next few sessions. The point of this exercise was to begin to show you why ruby is great.</p>

<p>It is often possible to write ruby in a way that reads a lot like English. Hopefully you found this with the above example - even though you&#8217;ve only just met ruby you were probably able to have a reasonably guess at what the above code did.</p>

<p>Ruby is an incredibly powerful and flexible language. It is a modern language - created in the 1990s by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz). A large part of his design philosophy is centered around optimizing for developer happiness - making a language that is a pleasure to program in. If you haven&#8217;t already programmed in another language, you might not fully appreciate this, but - take it from someone who has - ruby is awesome!</p>

	<div class="tab-pane " id="3_irb">
	

		<h2>Interactive ruby</h2>
		<p>One of the great things about an interpreted language is that it&#8217;s often possible to interact with the interpreter in real time.</p>
<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<p>On the command line type <code>irb</code> to enter an interactive ruby session.</p>
</div>
<p>Irb stands for <strong>i</strong>nteractive <strong>r</strong>u<strong>b</strong>y. You can write ruby code in it and it will evaluate it.</p>
<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<p>Write <code>2 + 2</code> into irb and press enter.</p>
</div>
<p>You should see something like the following:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='irb'><span class='go'>001: &gt; 2 + 2</span>
<span class='go'> =&gt; 4 </span>
<span class='go'>002: &gt; </span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>2 + 2</code> is a ruby <em>expression</em>. The <code>=&gt;</code> symbol tells you what this expression evaluates to. If you try just typing <code>4</code> at the irb prompt, you will see that <code>4</code> is an expression that evaluates to itself.</p>
<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the file <code>ruby1/arithmetic.rb</code> in Sublime Text</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>For each expression:</p>

<ol>
<li>See if you guess what it will evaluate to.</li>

<li>Try it in irb to check.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you have time, move on to the challenge at the end of the file.</p>
</li>
</ol>

	<div class="tab-pane " id="4_numbers">
	

		<h2>Numbers in ruby</h2>
		<p>Over the course of the last exercise you learnt a few things about numbers in ruby.</p>

<h3 id='brackets'>Brackets</h3>

<p>Ruby follows the standard laws of arithmetic when it comes to brackets:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='irb'><span class='go'>&gt; 2 + 5 * 3</span>
<span class='go'>=&gt; 17</span>
<span class='go'>&gt; (2 + 5) * 3</span>
<span class='go'>=&gt; 21</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id='division'>Division</h3>

<p>If you divide integers (whole numbers) in ruby you might not get the answer you expected:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='irb'><span class='go'>&gt; 5 / 2</span>
<span class='go'>=&gt; 2</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is pretty standard in a lot of programming languages. The sum is interpreted to mean &#8216;how many times will 2 go into 5&#8217;, i.e. two whole times, with a remainder of one. You can use <code>%</code> to find the remainder:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='irb'><span class='go'>&gt; 5 % 2</span>
<span class='go'>=&gt; 1</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you want your answer to be a decimal at least one of the numbers in the division must be a decimal:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='irb'><span class='go'>&gt; 5.0 / 2</span>
<span class='go'>=&gt; 2.5</span>
<span class='go'>&gt; 5 / 2.0</span>
<span class='go'>=&gt; 2.5</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id='numbers_as_objects'>Numbers as objects</h3>

<p>Ruby is a &#8216;true object orientated&#8217; language - pretty much everything is an <em>object</em>. We will talk more about object orientated programming in later sessions, but for now you should accept that this is (a) slightly unusual for a programming langauge and (b) lots of fun!</p>

<p>Numbers are no exception: they are objects and therefore have <em>methods</em> that you can call on them. Whereas in other languages you might have to do <code>Math.even?(5)</code>, in ruby you can essentially ask the number itself whether it is even or not:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='irb'><span class='go'>&gt; 5.even?</span>
<span class='go'>=&gt; false</span>
<span class='go'>&gt; 5.odd?</span>
<span class='go'>=&gt; true</span>
</code></pre></div><div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<p>In irb,</p>

<ol>
<li>Try <code>5.class</code>, to see what sort of object <code>5</code> is.</li>

<li>Compare this to <code>5.0.class</code>.</li>

<li>Try <code>5.methods</code>, to see what other methods you can call on <code>5</code>.</li>

<li>Try out a few of these methods (e.g. <code>5.abs</code>, <code>5.real?</code>, <code>5.between?(3,6)</code>)</li>
</ol>
</div>
	</div>

	
	<div class="tab-pane " id="5_variables">
	

		<h2>Variables</h2>
		<p>Like most progamming languages, ruby allows you to store values in within program by assigning them to <em>variables</em>.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='n'>x</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='mi'>1</span>

<span class='n'>y</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='mi'>2</span><span class='o'>*</span><span class='n'>x</span>

<span class='n'>x</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='mi'>2</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In ruby you don&#8217;t need to declare your variables anywhere (unlike in some other languages) - by assigning a value to them you bring them into existence. If the variable already holds a value and you reassign it the new value will overwrite the old.</p>

<p>You also don&#8217;t need to say what sort of object they will hold. This can change over the &#8216;lifetime&#8217; of the variable:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='n'>x</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='mi'>1</span>
<span class='nb'>puts</span> <span class='n'>x</span>
<span class='n'>x</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;fish&quot;</span>
<span class='nb'>puts</span> <span class='n'>x</span>
</code></pre></div><div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<p>Type the above examples into irb. Note that all the numeric operations and methods work exactly as before. For example, try <code>y.odd?</code>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id='an_impossible_equation'>An impossible equation</h3>

<p>Assignment works by setting the variable on the left to the expression on the right.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='n'>x</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='n'>x</span> <span class='o'>+</span> <span class='mi'>1</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>At first the above statement might appear confusing. It looks like it might be an impossible mathematical equation. The equals <strong>isn&#8217;t like = in maths</strong> - it is an assignment. The statement means &#8216;set the new value of x to be one more than the old value of x&#8217;.</p>

<h3 id='variable_names'>Variable names</h3>

<p>Local variables start with a lower case letter. That&#8217;s all we&#8217;ll be dealing with for now. They must not have any spaces.</p>

<p>Usual in ruby to use underscored names, e.g. <code>user_name</code> or <code>this_is_a_stupidly_long_variable_name</code>.</p>
<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<p>Below is some code containing variables a and b</p>

<pre><code> a = 1
 b = 10
 a = b</code></pre>

<p>Which of the following is correct?:</p>

<ol>
<li>The value of a is 1. The value of b is 10.</li>

<li>The value of a is 10. The value of b is 10.</li>

<li>The value of a is 1. The value of b is 1.</li>

<li>None of the above.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you&#8217;re not sure, try it out in <code>irb</code>!</p>
</div><hr /><div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<p><span>Note: this exercise has a lot more to do with maths than programming. If you don&#8217;t get it don&#8217;t worry!</span></p>

<p>Consider the expression</p>

<pre><code> x = (2 + 5*x - x**2)/5</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Let <code>x = 1.1</code></li>

<li>Write <code>x = (2 + 5*x - x**2)/5</code> and then evaluate this multiple times (using the up arrow in irb)</li>

<li>What happens? Can you explain why?</li>

<li>Let <code>x = 1</code> and do the same thing. What happens and why?</li>

<li>(Pointless extension.) Can you find other examples of parts 3 and 4? Can you prove you have all of them?</li>
</ol>
</div>
	</div>

	
	<div class="tab-pane " id="6_strings">
	

		<h2>Strings</h2>
		<p>We&#8217;ve already seen a string in action in <code>hello.rb</code>. We&#8217;ll now look in more detail at the different ways you can write a string in your code. When a string is written directly in your code (as opposed to being read in from user input) it is referred to as a string literal. We will look at the two most common ways of creating string literals.</p>

<h3 id='singlequoted_string_literals'>Single-quoted string literals</h3>

<p>Single-quoted strings are boring. They look almost exactly as you write them.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='nb'>puts</span> <span class='s1'>&#39;Hello \n Tom&#39;</span>
<span class='c1'># =&gt; Hello \n Tom</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are only two exceptions to this: <code>\&#39;</code> becomes <code>&#39;</code> and <code>\\</code> becomes <code>\</code>.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='nb'>puts</span> <span class='s1'>&#39;Dave\&#39;s house&#39;</span>
<span class='c1'># =&gt; Dave&#39;s house</span>
<span class='nb'>puts</span> <span class='s1'>&#39;Hello \ what is \\ going on?&#39;</span>
<span class='c1'># =&gt; Hello \ what is \ going on?</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Both of these make sense when you think about them:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You need something like <code>\&#39;</code> to become <code>&#39;</code>, otherwise it would be impossible to create a string with a <code>&#39;</code> character in it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Once you have <code>\&#39;</code> becoming <code>&#39;</code> you need something like <code>\\</code> to become <code>\</code>, otherwise it would be impossible to create a string ending in <code>\</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>So, single-quoted strings are boring. They replace the minimum amount of stuff possible.</p>

<h3 id='doublequoted_string_literals'>Double-quoted string literals</h3>

<p>Double-quoted strings are much more exciting. They allow all sorts of special characters, usually <em>escaped</em> with <code>\</code>. For example, <code>\n</code> in a string signifies a new line:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='nb'>puts</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;Hello </span><span class='se'>\n</span><span class='s2'> Tom&quot;</span>
<span class='c1'># =&gt; Hello</span>
<span class='c1'># =&gt; Tom</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>More importantly double-quoted strings allow you to do <em>string interpolation</em> - baking your own variables into a string, using the <code>#{ }</code> symbol:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='nb'>name</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;Tom&quot;</span>
<span class='nb'>puts</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;Hello </span><span class='si'>#{</span><span class='nb'>name</span><span class='si'>}</span><span class='s2'>&quot;</span>
<span class='c1'># =&gt; Hello Tom</span>
</code></pre></div><div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<ol>
<li>Open the file <code>hello_you.rb</code> in Sublime Text.</li>

<li>Read through the program to see if you can figure out what it does. Run it (<code>ruby hello_you.rb</code>) in the console (<strong>not</strong> irb) to see if you&#8217;re right.</li>

<li>Run the file <code>test_hello_you.rb</code>. You should see that the test fails.</li>

<li>Alter the file <code>hello_you.rb</code> so that instead of just showing the name you type (e.g. Bob) it instead shows &#8220;Hello Bob&#8221;</li>

<li>Run the test file again. Hopefully it should now pass.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>What we&#8217;ve just done is an example of something called <strong>test-driven development</strong> or <strong>TDD</strong> - writing a set of tests and then writing the code so that they pass. Test-driven development is something that some software developers go mad about. I&#8217;m not 100% convinced personally - writing tests before you write the code, necessitates having a pretty good idea of knowing exactly what you&#8217;re writing before you start. Possibly worryingly, I find that this is often not the case. What is really important is having ways to automatically test your code, whether those tests were written before you wrote your code, or immediately after it.</p>

<p>In this course we&#8217;ll often provide pre-written tests so that you can check your solutions to the exercises, TDD-style.</p>

<h3 id='fun_with_strings'>Fun with strings</h3>

<p>Ruby strings have a lot of methods that you can play with.</p>
<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<ol>
<li>Open the file <code>strings.rb</code></li>

<li>See if you can predict what will happen when you run each line.</li>

<li>See if you&#8217;re right in irb.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3 id='other_ways_of_creating_strings'>Other ways of creating strings</h3>

<p>There are other ways of creating strings. You probably won&#8217;t need to use them that often. For more information see <a href='http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax/Literals'>http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax/Literals</a> .</p>
	</div>

	
	<div class="tab-pane " id="7_rounding_up">
	

		<h2>Rounding up</h2>
		<p>You should have learn a few things about strings from the last exercise:</p>

<h3 id='string_methods'>String methods</h3>

<p>Ruby strings come with a lot of useful methods, e.g. <code>upcase</code>, <code>downcase</code>, <code>reverse</code>, <code>capitalize</code>. These methods return a new copy of the string with the action applied. The underlying string is unchanged.</p>

<p>These methods also exist in a <code>!</code> form: <code>upcase!</code>, <code>downcase!</code>, <code>reverse!</code>, <code>capitalize!</code>. These are applied to the actual version of the string that you call them on. <strong>They will change the string permanently.</strong> In ruby, the <code>!</code> on the end of a method is often a sign that that method could make lasting changes to the object you&#8217;re calling it on. Sometimes this is what you want, othertimes it isn&#8217;t. Be warned!</p>

<h3 id='multiplying_strings'>Multiplying strings</h3>

<p>You can multiply strings by numbers:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='s2'>&quot;Tom&quot;</span> <span class='o'>*</span> <span class='mi'>3</span>
<span class='c1'>#=&gt; &quot;TomTomTom&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is nice but, in my experience, largely useless.</p>

<p>What is interesting is that the multiplication is not commutative:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='mi'>3</span> <span class='o'>*</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;Tom&quot;</span>
<span class='c1'># =&gt; Error</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Actually, it probably isn&#8217;t that interesting. You&#8217;ll probably never multiply any strings anyway.</p>
