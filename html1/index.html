		<h2>Introducing the URL</h2>
		<p>Many of our web interactions begin with a URL (<em>uniform resource locator</em>) being typed into our web browser address bar. Let&#8217;s look at an example: <code>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/</code>.</p>

<p>This URL has several different parts to it:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>http</code> : the <em>protocol</em> or <em>the how</em></li>

<li><code>www.bbc.co.uk</code> : the <em>host</em> or <em>the where</em></li>

<li><code>/news</code> : the <em>path</em> or <em>the what</em></li>
</ul>

<p>When we type the URL into the address bar a request is sent over the internet and some information is returned to us.</p>

<p>The protocol describes how the information is transmitted. Other possibilities include <code>https</code> for secured communication, <code>ftp</code> for file transfer and <code>git</code> which we&#8217;ll learn about later.</p>

<p>The host describes where the information should come from and the path tells that location precisely what information to send.</p>

<p>In general a URL can be more complicated than this. URLs can also contain <em>query parameters</em>, <em>fragments</em> and <em>port information</em>. We will leave these for now but will point them out when we meet them later. Instead we will focus on exactly what information is being sent and who is sending it.</p>

		<h2>Domain Names and Servers</h2>
		<p>You can think of the internet as a massive network of computers that can send files to one another. The computers that hold web pages are called <em>servers</em>. In general they are large, specialised computers that are permanently connected to the internet.</p>

<p>Each computer on the internet has an address (an <em>IP address</em>) so that requests can be sent to it and files returned - much like a telephone number. The backbone of the internet is a network of <em>routers</em> that are responsible for routing files from one IP address to another.</p>

<p>IP addresses are a sequence of numbers and &#8217;.&#8217;s such as <code>212.58.244.67</code>. These aren&#8217;t very easy to remember. Instead the internet works on a domain name system, that matches domain names such as <code>bbc.co.uk</code> to IP addresses.</p>
<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<p>Type <code>212.58.244.67</code> into your browser&#8217;s address bar. What happens?</p>
</div>
<p>One of the first things that happens when you type a URL into your browser is a <em>DNS lookup</em>: your computer contacts a DNS server (<em>Domain Name System server</em>), which is basically a massive address book of IP addresses. The DNS server converts the domain name from the URL (e.g. <code>bbc.co.uk</code>) into an address for a server (such as <code>212.57.244.67</code>).</p>

<p>If you want to put up your own website at your own domain name you need two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>A web server to serve your site</li>

<li>A domain name to point towards it</li>
</ol>

<p>There are many options for web servers - you don&#8217;t have to physically have your own one. There are many companies that will offer web hosting, often providing you with space on a shared server. Later in the course we will use the free hosting offered by GitHub through GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>To buy a domain name you need to use a domain registrar. Examples include <span>123-reg.co.uk</span>, <span>godaddy.com</span> and <span>namecheap.com</span>. You pay the registrar to contact the body who manages a TLD (e.g. .com, .org., .co.uk) and put your server&#8217;s IP address in their DNS address book. If someone else already owns the domain you might be able to buy it off them, but this can be expensive!</p>

<p>Many domain registrars will try to sell you hosting and other site building tools when you buy a domain. It&#8217;s important to remember that the domain name is completely separate from the hosting and you don&#8217;t need to do them both through the same company - don&#8217;t buy anything you&#8217;re not going to use.</p>

		<h2>Web technologies</h2>
		<p>Once the address of the web server has been found your request is forwarded on to it. The web server will interpret your request and send back one or more files. We now look at the technology involved in this process.</p>

<p>When talking about web technology it is useful to split things up into server-side technology and client-side technology. Server-side relates to anything that happens on the web server. Client-side is anything the server sends back to your browser.</p>

<h3 id='clientside'>Client-side</h3>

<p>The main three client-side technologies are HTML, CSS and Javascript. Client-side stuff has to be interpreted by your browser, so there are relatively few possibilities.</p>

      <h3>CSS</h3>
      <p><em>Cascading Style Sheets</em> tell your browser how to display that information.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class='span3'>
    <div class='thumbnail'>
      <img alt='' src='/assets/js.jpeg' style='height: 128px;' />
      <h3>Javascript</h3>
      <p>Javascript is a programming language that can be used to provide client-side interactivity.</p>
    </div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ll look at these in more detail later in the course.</p>

<h3 id='serverside'>Server-side</h3>

<p>There are two main possibilities server-side: either your site is static or dynamic. In a static site all the pages are pre-prepared and the web server just sends them to the browser. In a dynamic site the pages are prepared on-the-fly pulling information out of a database depending on what the user asked for. Most of the sites you can think of will be dynamic sites (e.g. <span>facebook.com</span>, <span>reddit.com</span>, <span>amazon.com</span>, ..).</p>

<p>There are many options for building a dynamic server-side site - you&#8217;re pretty much free to do what you like. Some common choices are:</p>
<ul class='thumbnails'>
  <li class='span3'>
    <div class='thumbnail'>

		<h2>Investigating HTML</h2>
		<p>HTML (<em>HyperText Markup Language</em>) is a way of writing information so that it can be interpreted by a web browser. It is <em>not</em> a programming language - you can&#8217;t do calculations in it - it is a <em>markup</em> language.</p>

<p>Back in the early days of the web HTML would both store the information and tell the browser how to display it. People then realised that this was a bad idea - making a small change such as changing the colour of a heading would require edits all over the place, which made sites hard to maintain. HTML is now used just to display the information (text etc.) that is stored in the page.</p>
<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<ol>
<li>Open Google Chrome</li>

<li>Go to any web site (eg. <a href='/'>this one</a>)</li>

<li>View the page source (View &gt; Developer &gt; View Source)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>HTML probably won&#8217;t make a lot of sense to you at first but you might be able to see some of the words from the page.</p>

<p>A slightly nicer way to look at HTML is to use the Chrome Developer Tools.</p>
<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<ol>
<li>Open Google Chrome</li>

<li>Go to any web site</li>

<li>Look at the page using developer tools (View &gt; Developer &gt; Developer Tools)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Using the magnifying glass (bottom left) You can hover over the bits of the page and it will show you the relevant bits of HTML. We will use Chrome Developer Tools a lot throughout the course.</p>

	<div class="tab-pane " id="5_command_line">
	

		<h2>Meet the Command Line</h2>
		<p>If you are using a mac, open Terminal.app. If you are on windows, as part of the package you downloaded from <a href='www.railsinstaller.org'>RailsInstaller</a> you should now have a program called <code>gitbash</code>. Open that!</p>

<p>These terminals are a way to interact with your computer programmatically. If you are doing any software development you will need to get to grips with using the terminal, as many of the programmes you will use will be run from the terminal, instead of by clicking an icon.</p>

<p>The first thing you will need to get used to is moving around. Start by printing the name of the directory you are in:</p>

<pre><code>$ pwd</code></pre>

<p>Then have a look at what&#8217;s in that directory ( <em>list</em> the contents):</p>

<pre><code>$ ls</code></pre>

<p>To move up a directory ( <em>change directory</em> ) do</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ..</code></pre>

<p>To move back do</p>

<pre><code>$ cd name_of_the_directory</code></pre>

<p>Your commandline will help you: <kbd>tab</kbd> can often be used to auto-complete names of files, the up arrow can be used to cycle through previous commands that you have typed.</p>

<p>You should navigate to your <code>coding_course</code> folder that you created last week, using <code>cd</code>. When you get there create a new directory (_make directory_) for your site:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir first_site</code></pre>

<p>Note: choosing names without spaces makes command line navigation easier.</p>

		<h2>Creating an HTML page</h2>
		<p>We&#8217;ll now create our first HTML page.</p>
<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>
<p>Task:</p>
</strong>
<ol>
<li>Create a new folder in your documents called &#8216;coding_course&#8217;</li>

<li>Inside that create another folder called &#8216;first_site&#8217;</li>

<li>Open Sublime Text</li>

<li>Write &#8220;Hello&#8221;</li>

<li>Save the file as &#8216;index.html&#8217; in the &#8216;first_site&#8217; folder</li>

<li>Open &#8216;index.html&#8217; in Chrome (File &gt; Open &#8230;)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Sublime Text is a text editor. When writing HTML (and code in general) it&#8217;s important to use a program that doesn&#8217;t add any formatting of its own. For example, if you wrote &#8220;hello&#8221; and saved it in Microsoft Word it would create a complicated file which would include a load of formatting information and other stuff. We want files to be saved exactly how we see them.</p>

<p>There are many different possibilities for text editors. You probably already have one of Notepad or TextEdit on your computer. Sublime Text (and other editors such as NotePad++, Vim, gEdit, ..) will add <em>syntax highlighting</em> for you - they&#8217;ll colour different bits of your progamming language to make it easier to read.</p>
