// Handle back button issues with Twitter Bootstrap's tab component.
// Based on: http://stackoverflow.com/a/10120221/81769
// It has been changed to avoid the following side effects:
// - Switching tabs was being added to navigation history which is undesirable
//   (Worked around this by using location.replace instead of setting the hash property)
// - Browser scroll position was lost due to fragment navigation
//   (Worked around this by converting #id values to #!id values before navigating.)
$(document).ready(function () {
 
    if (location.hash.substr(0,2) == "#!") {
        $("a[href='#" + location.hash.substr(2) + "']").tab("show");
    }
 
    $("a[data-toggle='tab']").on("shown", function (e) {
        var hash = $(e.target).attr("href");
        if (hash.substr(0,1) == "#") {
            location.replace("#!" + hash.substr(1));
        }
    });
