		<h2>Twitter Bootstrap</h2>
		<p>Last time we looked at how you can use CSS to change the appearance of your site. Making things look good with CSS is a bit of an art, which is only really acquired over time (or not, in my case!). Thankfully there are pre-existing solutions out there to make your life easier.</p>

<p><a href='http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/'>Twitter bootstrap</a> is set of CSS (&amp; Javascript) files, released by the makers of twitter. It makes a lot easier to produce websites that won&#8217;t make you want to sick up into your mouth everytime you look at them. We&#8217;ll now look at adding twitter bootstrap to your <code>first_site/index.html</code> page (you should have renamed your page to this as part of the homework).</p>

<p>To start with go to the <a href='http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap'>twitter bootstrap</a> website (notice that it&#8217;s hosted at github, like ours is!) and click the download button. When you&#8217;ve downloaded and unzipped the file, copy the <code>bootstrap</code> folder into your <code>first_site</code> folder.</p>

<p>When we covered CSS last time I mentioned that there are a few different ways of including it in your webpage. We did it by putting the css inside a <code>&lt;style&gt;..&lt;/style&gt;</code> tags in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your page. This time we&#8217;re going to do it by linking to a separate css file. This is more efficient, as it means that when someone&#8217;s browsing your site they don&#8217;t have to download the css file for each new page. In the head section of your <code>first_site/index.html</code> put the following line:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='html'><span class='nt'>&lt;link</span> <span class='na'>href=</span><span class='s'>&#39;bootstrap/css/bootstrap.css&#39;</span> <span class='na'>rel=</span><span class='s'>&#39;stylesheet&#39;</span><span class='nt'>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can also remove the <code>&lt;style&gt;..&lt;/style&gt;</code> tags and delete your css from last time if you want.</p>

<p>When you go to your browser and press refresh, things should look slightly better - bootstrap chooses slightly nicer fonts than the browser does by default. To get the full effects of bootstrap we need to tweak our html.</p>
