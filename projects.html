      <h1>Hotter or colder <small>Grace Copplestone</small></h1>
      <p class="lead">An alternative weather forecast | <a href='http://www.hotterorcolder.com'>link</a> | <a href='https://github.com/copplestone/hotter_or_colder_app'>code</a></p>

      <p></p>

      <h4>The app</h4>
        <p>Hotter or colder quite simply makes a comparison of the weather. GIven that the brain relies so heavily on comparisons, it seemed sensible to create a more intuitive weather forecast. Users can also submit a new location to be added to the site. Future developments might include additional comments. e.g. Rather than wetter or drier - Whether you should or shouldn't take an umbrella to work tomorrow.</p>

      <h4>The tech</h4>
        <p>The project was made using Sinatra and is hosted by Heroku. The hardest bit initially was fetching the data from the MET Office and breaking down the huge hashes to get the numbers I needed. I'm storing the information in a database using MongoDB. That was pretty tricky but it saved me later on when I wanted to add the additional buttons as I was just able to pull out the extra numbers I had already stored. Hotter or colder is not currently a profitable product however I imagine it's of a similar standard to that needed for an MVP. Therefore, on top of the coding I've gained a vague idea of the time required to get through the first cycle of the Lean Startup.</p>

      <p class="lead">Chat Up Lines | <a href='http://stormy-crag-1959.herokuapp.com/'>link</a> | <a href='https://github.com/nataliejpg/sinatra_project_1'>code</a></p>

      <p></p>

      <h4>The app</h4>
        <p>CUAAS is similar to FOAAS and creates chat up lines for users to send to the person of their dreams. It stored the information so that the recipient can access the same page by clicking a link in the email. Intended users are anyone with a vague sense of humour (or indeed actually looking to ask someone out).</p>

      <h4>The tech</h4>
        <p>First used with basic sinatra structure based on urls (as FOASS) then Pony added and finally a mongo database, thereby changing the structure somewhat. Hardest bit was mongo as I have database issues. Also has a tiny bit of JavaScript which I struggled with but was really good to learn. </p>

      <p class="lead">London museum recomendation service | <a href='http://salty-reaches-8484.herokuapp.com/'>link</a> | <a href='https://github.com/Rosie-Brigham/stuffed-animals'>code</a></p>

      <p></p>

      <h4>The app</h4>
        <p>Its a simple service for those visiting London, or people who have, after being in London so long lost all inspiration for exactly what to do (as it can get a bit overwhelming at times). </p>
        <p>It offers concise recommendations based on first hand experiences, which you wouldn't normally find on the usual websites.</p>
        <p>It also probably has a few spelling mistakes, I'm sorry about that.</p>

      <h4>The tech</h4>
        <p>Made using Sinatra, though I probably should have used rails! I started it off as an experiment then I kept on wanting to add to it and add to it. </p>
        <p>ad of course there is still more stuff I want to do to it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Hardest bits were navigating and working out how the get and post requests worked with multiple pages (in a french camping site with no internet).</p>
        <p>To add to that the css, which I only just realized still isn't how I want it to be when viewed on any computer other than my own...</p>

      <h1>Bar FlipFlop <small>Alexandra Nikolova</small></h1>
      <p class="lead">bar flipflop's drunkards playbook | <a href='http://vast-thicket-6143.herokuapp.com/'>link</a> | <a href='https://github.com/everhooder/barflipflop'>code</a></p>

      <p></p>

      <h4>The app</h4>
        <p>What it should do (the full functionality is not ready yet):</p>
        <p>It is a guestbook of bar FlipFlop's clients: they fill in a form with their favorite drink, names, email, birthday and leave a comment about the bar.</p>
        <p>Depending on the drink selected, they receive a specific badge (e.g. &quot;beer&quot; -&gt; &quot;beer belly&quot; badge.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In return, the bar gives them 2 of their favorite drink on their birthday.</p>

      <h4>The tech</h4>
        <p>I have used Ruby on Rails and ZURB foundation. </p>
        <p>I created a scaffold model for the drunkards first; then a welcome controller. Will also add another model for making the drinks to be selected from a list (drop-down menu) and need an id in order to print specific badge.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, it takes more time than expected due to the fact I have managed to mess it all up couple of times and needed to do a lot of work again.</p>
        <p>So, it will be developed in the following 1-2 weeks as well.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Btw, at the moment the whole design is broken (not sure why, something connected with foundation), so it looks terrible xD </p>
        <p>Will work on fixing it till I manage to make it look like at my local server.</p>

      <h1>Language Love Letters <small>Sally Poundall</small></h1>
      <p class="lead">Send personalized love messages in the language of your choice. | <a href='http://www.languageloveletters.com'>link</a> | <a href='https://github.com/sallypoundall/languageloveletters'>code</a></p>

      <p></p>

      <h4>The app</h4>
        <p>My app allows people to send personalized love messages in the native language of their partner. I actually came up with the idea when I came across this quote from Nelson Mandela 'If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.' From my experience this quote is so very true and so I thought it would be a nice idea to set up an app that allowed English people to send love messages to their boyfriends/girlfriends/spouses in their native language. Also this app was the perfect project for me because it combined my love of languages with my new-found interest in coding :)</p>

      <h4>The tech</h4>
        <p>My app uses:</p>
        <p>- ruby</p>
        <p>- sinatra</p>
        <p>- a teensy bit of mongoid, which allows me to display the number of love messages that have been sent</p>
        <p>- a little bit of jquery which makes the social media buttons change colour on hover</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Other things I learnt:</p>
        <p>- how to add a custom email to google (mail@languageloveletters.com), and then make this email the default from which all messages are sent from</p>
        <p>- how to add a custom domain to my heroku app (www.languageloveletters.com)</p>
        <p>- how to create forms with bootstrap (took me a while to figure them out!)</p>
        <p>- how to create my own social media buttons that sit with the look and feel of my webpage, and which link to twitter, google+ and facebook</p>
        <p>- how to create images with transparent backgrounds using paint.net - I learnt this through adding the social media buttons</p>
        <p>- a smattering of Spanish &amp; German (though I can't say I've come away with any Russian haha)</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>To be honest the whole thing was hard; trying to get those social media buttons to look good and to change colour when I wanted was a mission in itself; also working out how to set out the structure of the website (what should come first? entering details or choosing a language?) was a bit of a headache, trying to get all information in the right place so that when it comes to sending the email all the right information is there. Also trying to find the love messages themselves was very time consuming, though I guess you wouldn't call that 'difficult'. The easiest bit for me was doing the CSS and making it all look pretty :) All in all I learnt a hell of a lot doing this project and I can safely say I've come away from CodeFirst:Girls with something I'm really proud of!</p>

      <h1>Expedition Society <small>Elina Desaine</small></h1>
      <p class="lead">Society Trip calender | <a href='http://still-fjord-3629.herokuapp.com/'>link</a> | <a href='https://github.com/desaine3/Uni'>code</a></p>

      <p></p>

      <h4>The app</h4>
        <p>This allows the Expedition Society to add new trips, allowing members of the society to see which trips are available to sign up for, as well as view other trips that have happened. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Future Expansion: Have a sign up button where the user can fill out a mini form to sign up to a trip, and then they get an e-mail, saying if they are on the trip or on the reserve list. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Have a log in system, where by only committee members can add and edit trips. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Allow people to add comments and blogs of how the trip was, a bit like a diary. </p>

      <h4>The tech</h4>
        <p>This project is made using Ruby on Rails, hosted by Heroku. It makes use of bootstrap elements such as navigation bars, media lists, thumbnails and jubotrons. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I think the hardest part was deploying the app onto Heroku, as well as understanding how all pages link together. Also, at times it was tricky to embed ruby conditional statements and loops within the html/ erb code. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Most of the learning was done through de-bugging, which made bits and bobs of my knowledge come together, to understand the whole system. </p>

      <p class="lead">Discovering Super-Curriculars | <a href='http://www.sclogs.co.uk'>link</a> | <a href='https://github.com/NadiDami/access_project'>code</a></p>

      <p>Username: sclog@example.com; Password: sclogtest</p>

      <h4>The app</h4>
        <p>My project represents an online space for 12-15 year olds to discover super-curricular activities and keep a record of ones that they take part in. The aim is to introduce young secondary school students to the idea of going beyond the school syllabus to learn new things and develop new interests that will serve them well when applying to university and beyond. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>By keeping track of their super-curricular activities, students can refer back to ideas they've discovered, develop them, and share with their friends and family.</p>

      <h4>The tech</h4>
        <p>The project is based in Rails. I began by setting up a static page framework in Rails, before incorporating a blog controller. Hence, the first thing I had to learn was how to work with the two different frameworks and how to integrate them.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>After putting up some initial content, I then set up a user login system using Devise. This was pretty straightforward. The most difficult part was working out how to make Sclog posts private, such that users could only see their posts when they logged in and not everybody else's. I also had to discover how to put in some security measures to prevent users from discovering other Sclog posts that they haven't authored. </p>

      <h4>The app</h4>
        <p>Flatbuddy is a task manager for flatshares. You can list, assign and track the various tasks that need to be done in your flat such as bills, groceries, meetings with the landlord. Flatbuddy will let you know once a task is overdue and send an email to the relevant flatmate so you do not have to be the bad guy anymore. </p>

      <h4>The tech</h4>
        <p>This project was a great way to review what we have learned during the course, using ruby on rails. The hardest part was probably to link the different models.</p>
